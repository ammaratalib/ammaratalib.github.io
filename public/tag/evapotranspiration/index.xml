The potentials of random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate and forecast daily ET for corn, soybeans, and potatoes in diverse agricultural farms was evaluated in this research. The proposed modeling architecture provides a field-scale, locally calibrated tool for accurate prediction and short-term forecasting of daily ET in areas lacking in situ ET, metrological, and biophysical data. Furthermore, since there is no clear understanding of minimum required predictors for accurate estimates of ET, our models with different sets of predictors can help to understand the need for essential or minimum drivers for different crop fields on various soil textures in areas with scarce data. 
&lt;p&gt;The goals of this research include, how well can empirical ML models predict and forecast ET 3 days in advance in irrigated and rain-fed agricultural lands across the Midwest US? And What are important drivers for predicting and forecasting ET 3 days in advance in irrigated and non-irrigated areas?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prediction and forecasting models for ET based on RF and LSTM framework with 5, 11, and 16 predictors was proposed. For all model experiments, simulations were based on daily time step from 2003-2019. The selection of sixteen model input predictors for RF_16 and LSTM_16 model was due to their influence on ET and their availability for agricultural sites. After calibration and validation, empirical models of RF and LSTM were benchmarked against output from process-based model ET from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) version 2 LSM model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the two ET prediction algorithms for the test data, which demonstrated the ability of the calibrated models to generalize to unseen ET observations (test data) from eddy covariance flux towers across multiple crop types. The evaluation statistics indicated that there is a good agreement between the predicted and observed ET values across corn, soybeans, and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis for RF model showed that VP and crop coefficients were the most important predictors for irrigated crops, while short wave radiation and enhanced vegetation index were key predictors for non-irrigated crops.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multistep forecast model that can forecast ET three days ahead of time using RF and LSTM models was developed. Finally, the importance of model predictors was calculated for both prediction and forecast model versions of RF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pines are wetter on the surface. But later the difference between pine and potatoes soil moisture decreases. Pines have more transpiration and less soil evaporation. Deeper in the ground (around 18 inches depth) potatoes have more soil moisture. Water use by different crop types in Midwest (2017,2018) was compared under different soil types. Even same crop type can lead to different water used based on soil condition. Cumulatively corn water loss in Illinois (IL) was about four inches higher than WI potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In our ability to sustain food production, it is important to know how much water our crops need. Current drought forecasts cover large regions and are not specific to individual farms. Here, we seek to improve forecasting of how crops drought stress changes over time during different stages of growth through advanced mapping and modeling of evapotranspiration (ET) with NASA space borne sensors. We developed an algorithm that can accurately predict and forecast farm-scale regional daily out to 3 days. We use these forecasts to determine what varieties of a crops use less water or what varieties are best performing under water stress conditions. We hypothesized that thermal products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and meteorological information provide the resolution and temporal repeat frequency necessary to develop ET products. These goals were accomplished by forecasting water demand (ET loss) by crops with help of ensemble machine learning algorithms with use of meteorological data, MODIS products and ground observation from flux towers. From these products, we developed, calibrated and evaluated a new crop ET product against field measurements of ET from a network of crop eddy covariance flux towers in Midwest USA. These towers are currently operating in irrigated and rain fed field corn, soybean, wheat, clover and potato farms under a range of water management strategies. Daily ET forecast (3 days) model based on random forest (RF) has R2 and RMSE of 0.72 mm and 0.76mm respectively while recurrent neural network (RNN) ensemble forecast model was able to forecast 3 days ET with R2 and RMSE of 0.71 mm and 0.78 mm respectively. New field-scale ET maps can provide deep insights into how farmers could use limited water resources efficiently to maintain productivity, while sustaining surface water resources in the face of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
