Direct ET measurements are particularly essential for managing forests as pressures on high-quality surface water supply increase. Our study investigates how forest disturbances, climate change, and ET interact to influence the water cycle in the eastern U.S., where surface water regeneration plays a critical role in local water supply systems. We hypothesized that the biotic stress and mortality by HWA at the eastern hemlock site would cause an initial decrease in ET followed by an increase as deciduous species replaced hemlock. We also expected to find larger shifts in ET in the non-growing season due to the stress and mortality of the evergreen hemlock trees, coupled with increasingly warmer winter conditions that allow higher year-round transpiration. At both sites, we hypothesized that the meteorological drivers associated with PET would increase year-round due to higher temperatures and vapor pressure deficit with climate change. Figure demonstrates that both EMS and HEM tower shows a decline in ET in the initial time period. For example, ET has declined significantly (p=1.7^10-2) from 587.2 to 374.2 during 2003-2008 with a negative slope of -9.2 and percent change of 31.5%. HEM tower also showed a significant decline (p=2.9^10-1) in ET from 565.7 to 278.9 mm with a steep slope of -26 and percent change of 60.6%. After an initial decline in ET at both sites, an increase in ET was observed for the later period of time series. For example, at EMS site, ET was slightly increased (p=6.9*10-1) from 374.2 to 464.5 mm with a slope of 4.1 and percent change of 12%. Similarly HEM site ET also increased from 278.9-424 with a slope of 3.3 and a change of 12%.\nThe figure shows a significant decrease at a rate of -0.004 mol m-2 s-1 year-1 (38.6%) over this time period (Kendall τ = -0.34, p = 0.007). Time series trends for growing season gs paralleled those of the annual gs with a significant decrease at a rate of -0.006 mol m-2 per year (Kendall τ = -0.40, p = 0.002). At the EMS site the non-growing season gs did not have a significant trend through time. A t-test found that the mean annual gs of 0.32 mol m-2 s-1 with a range of 0.22–0.42 mol m-2 s-1 (SD=0.05) for 2005-2023 was significantly lower than that of EMS (t-test, p = 2.24^10-16).\nAt the EMS site, NETRAD was identified as the most influential meteorological factor affecting ET, followed by month, GPP, VPD, and PAR. In contrast, at the HEM site, GPP was the most significant factor influencing ET, followed by NETRAD, NEE, VPD, and Tair. The correlation between GPP and ET is stronger at the HEM site compared to the EMS site. Conversely, the importance of NETRAD is greater at the EMS site than at the HEM site.\nA presentation detailing the findings of this research was delivered in Water Science Conference (WaterSciCon24).\n","date":1701734400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701734400,"objectID":"afbdfb1146e7c0ac5135e452164127e9","permalink":"/research/harvard_forest/","publishdate":"2023-12-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/harvard_forest/","section":"research","summary":"Long-term changes in PET and ET are due to increased atmospheric demand for water vapor.

Neurodegenerative processes, which affect the brain of PD patients, may also have negative effects on the retina. An optical coherence tomography image can be obtained in a non-invasive, quick, and cost-effective manner using optical interferometry. Using this review, we will assess if retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and retinal thickness (RT) differ between patients with PD and healthy individuals. The majority of reports indicate that RNFLT tends to be thinner in patients with Parkinson’s disease, despite different studies providing conflicting results. Figures above depict choroid and capillary changes in early-stage Parkinson’s disease. According to our review, PD patients had lower RNFLTg, nasal retinal segment (RTn), visual acuity (VA), and intraocular pressure (IOP) scores. It is possible that lower VA scores were caused by the thinning of the RNFLTg and RTn. Thus, future studies should evaluate the reason for lower IOP values in non-glaucomatous IPD patients, and more comprehensive studies should be performed on a larger population.\nFigures source:\nZhang, Y., Yang, L., Gao, Y. et al.

The shortage of GW in the WCS is caused by many factors, including climate variability, fast expansion of irrigation, increasing high-capacity wells, and increasing population. For sustainable water resource management, there is an urgent need to develop a computationally-efficient and easy-to-update framework with the capability of efficient incorporation of recently developed and regularly updated environmental datasets (e.g., remote sensing maps of evapotranspiration and soil moisture).\rThe research questions for this project include: Using computationally efficient ML models, can easy-to-obtain remote sensing derived environmental datasets be combined to accurately predict GW dynamics across the WCS? How does GW anomaly vary in space and across the WCS? How pumping and crop type change can influence this anomaly forecasting?\nStatic and dynamic variables were used to build LSTM model for prediction of GW depth at the 26 well locations in the WCS region monthly from 1958 to 2020.\nThe effect of topography-related drivers is more conspicuous than SWE drivers. For example, for four wells, MAE was reduced by greater than 10 %, but for eight wells, MAE increased by greater than 10 %. Additionally, these three wells with the highest % change in MAE were located on the northeast side of WCS. All drivers, except meteorology-associated drivers, increased MAE for well_4101 when excluded. Well_1701 MAE was also increased when other drivers were excluded except for topography-related drivers. Based on permutation feature importance, PDSI, SW radiation, soil moisture, wind speed, and runoff were among the most important features. Pumping or irrigation demand has a higher relative importance to GW anomalies forecast compared to land use change. There is a direct connection between pumping and groundwater level change based on simple physics, but initially, it wasn’t clear whether irrigation demand would have a more substantial impact on groundwater anomalies than land use change since land use changes determine irrigation demand because of their correlation. Groundwater dynamics are closely related to agricultural irrigation in the WCS. In our observations, negative anomaly means shallow GW, so pumping has greater influence on shallow GW. Hence model can better estimate anomaly for shallower water. Pumping makes GW deeper so the anomaly becomes positive.

Uruguay is a unique population for not carrying out genome-wide association study (GWAS) even though they have an increased susceptibility to diabetes and have increased insulin resistance. The specific objective of this research is: 1) to identify common genetic variants underlying the risk of T2D in the Uruguay population using GWAS and 2) to test provisory implicated genes in T2D using a candidate gene association study.\nFor objective one, stage one of the GEWAS approach includes a GWAS scan on alleles with SNP call rate \u0026gt;95% (minor allele frequency \u0026gt;1%) in Uruguay Population with 5,450 cases with T2D 12,550 controls. Then in stage two, replication testing of 20-30 SNPs will be done, followed by sequencing, linkage disequilibrium structure analysis and eQTLs in stage three. Another approach in this study for objective 2 includes a candidate genes association study based on T2D-associated genes from literature (Barroso et al., 2003) using 500 cases and controls. First, SNPs and haplotypes associated with diseases will be identified and tested using a genetic Model showing association with disease in a case-control study. Then we will test SNPs and Haplotypes associated with Disease in QT scenarios of body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin.\nResults of this research proposal can shed light on whether there was heterogeneity of effect between the Uruguay population and other Europeans. We expect some loci to show a consistent direction of effect in the Uruguay population and Europeans and the remaining loci to be associated with T2D at P \u0026lt; 0.05 in only the Uruguay population.\nReferences:\nBorse, S.

African Americans have the highest incidence of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, tend to be younger at the time of first stroke event, and their strokes tend to be more severe with higher morbidity and result in higher mortality. The causes of health disparities are complex and include societal issues such as institutional racism, discrimination, socioeconomic status, poor access to health care lack of health insurance, poor understanding of the relationship between obesity, diabetes, and CVD among low-income African American communities. In addition, community-level barriers, such as limited access to supermarkets with healthy food items, can lead to unhealthy dietary habits. However, the prevalence of these chronic diseases across racial groups cannot be solely explained by socioeconomic status. Regardless of the ability to speak and understand English, speaking a language other than English at home confers a higher risk for not receiving appropriate health care. Therefore, changes at the policy level for equal access to high-quality care are paramount to reducing health care disparities. Higher morbidity and mortality rates caused by CVD and diabetes can lead to higher care costs in patients and a disproportionate burden on African Americans.\nHigher morbidity and mortality rates caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes can lead to higher care costs in patients, and a disproportionate burden is on minorities. Therefore, addressing the causes of these disparities and utilizing intervention to control CVD and diabetes in one of the largest minority groups in the US, i.e., African Americans, can potentially decrease healthcare costs.\nThe goal of this study was to assess the causes of diabetes and CVD health disparities among African populations and investigate what intervention are out there to mitigate disparities. These disparities other than SES include patient provider relationship (implicit biases), medical mistrust and community level barriers. Centuries of racial discrimination led to medical mistrust among African Americans and lingering effects persists decades after Tuskegee Syphilis Study.\nWe explored interventions to mitigate these disparities. Those interventions include improving access to care and quality of care. Interventions to eliminate the Black-White disparity in CVD and diabetes control would avert thousands of deaths from CVD in Black Americans. These CVD and diabetes disparities indicate underlying variations in health behavior, medical treatments and need to evaluate causes of these difference and targeted intervention efforts. The health care disparities trends have implications for policy makers, public health practitioners and clinicians to move towards cardiovascular health equity for African Americans. Addressing the causes of these disparities and proposing intervention can decrease health care costs and burden for African Americans.\nReferences\nBaumgartner, J., Collins, S., Radley, D., \u0026amp; Hayes, S.

The proposed modeling architecture provides a field-scale, locally calibrated tool for accurate prediction and short-term forecasting of daily ET in areas lacking in situ ET, metrological, and biophysical data. Furthermore, since there is no clear understanding of minimum required predictors for accurate estimates of ET, our models with different sets of predictors can help to understand the need for essential or minimum drivers for different crop fields on various soil textures in areas with scarce data. The goals of this research include, how well can empirical ML models predict and forecast ET 3 days in advance in irrigated and rain-fed agricultural lands across the Midwest US? And What are important drivers for predicting and forecasting ET 3 days in advance in irrigated and non-irrigated areas?\nPrediction and forecasting models for ET based on RF and LSTM framework with 5, 11, and 16 predictors was proposed. For all model experiments, simulations were based on daily time step from 2003-2019. The selection of sixteen model input predictors for RF_16 and LSTM_16 model was due to their influence on ET and their availability for agricultural sites. After calibration and validation, empirical models of RF and LSTM were benchmarked against output from process-based model ET from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) version 2 LSM model.\nThe performance of the two ET prediction algorithms for the test data, which demonstrated the ability of the calibrated models to generalize to unseen ET observations (test data) from eddy covariance flux towers across multiple crop types.

The goal of this study is 1) Forecast field-scale short-term evapotranspiration (ET) for different crops in the U.S. Midwest and 2) improve a commonly used satellite-driven regional crop evapotranspiration model (WISP). The first goal is achieved by building a prediction and forecasting empirical model based on machine learning. We compare two approaches, neural networks with Long short-term memory (LSTM) and random forest (RF) applied to nineteen crop sites in a range of crop types, soils, and irrigation usage that have continuous ET measurements made by eddy covariance. In general, performance of RF exceeded LSTM in most cases and forecasts were found to be reliable out to three days. Unlike rainfed crops, we found irrigated crops ET prediction requires including additional information related to physical properties of sites (soil types, crop coefficient, cumulative growing degree days). For the second goal, we evaluated ET predictions from WISP against some of these towers. Overestimation of ET in WISP arises from faulty parameterization of longwave radiation clear-sky emissivity. We applied an inverse approach to estimate corrected clear sky emissivity parameters. ET calculated based on corrected parameters reduced most of the model’s ET bias and lowered RMSE.

The performance of land surface model-based AET, reanalysis, and remote sensing products varies at different spatio-temporal scales. In the Central Sands Regions of Wisconsin, irrigation agriculture plays a fundamental role in supporting regional agricultural production and rural community development. For irrigation scheduling, farmers often rely on the Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model, developed by soil scientists at UW-Madison and based on satellite data. WISP is a regional model based on the Priestley Taylor approach and provides Potential ET (PET) estimates that can be scaled to ET based on percent canopy cover.\nIn 2018, with support from the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Growers Association Water Task Force, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the UW Center for Climatic Research, our lab installed eddy covariance flux towers on a center-pivot irrigated potato field (US-CS1) from June 2018-May 2019, the Tri-County School Forest pine stand Sept 2018-, a 2nd potato field (US-CS3) from June 2019-June 2020, and a 3rd potato field (US-CS4) from June 2020-present. Links to graphs, tables, and publications are at project website [Water use in Wisconsin Potatoes and Pine] (https://flux.aos.wisc.edu/potato)\nThis research evaluates sources of bias in the WISP model and develops a correction using eddy covariance (EC) observations. AET observations were made for five years (2018–2022), using EC systems in irrigated potatoes fields in Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS) region. Multi-source ET datasets should be employed in future studies to enhance confidence in remotely sensed ET related water budgets.\nThe source of uncertainty in the model could be due to model inputs of coefficients used in empirical equations. Those coefficients are not regionally calibrated, which could lead to underestimating the energy budget. Wisconsin is humid, where ET is energy limited, and by correcting the energy budget, we expect to see reduced bias in model ET.\nThe WISP model overestimated ET before correction because modeled AET range for the WCS region was 7.17-7.48 mm before correction for July 19th, 2020, but after correction modeled AET_corr range was 5.59-5.86 mm. Total AET for the entire region for July 19th, 2020, is 569 mm before correction and 444.5 mm after modification, with a difference of 124.5 mm.\nA research paper detailing the findings of this research has been accepted in the journal of Agricultural and Forest Meteorology.\n","date":1599523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599523200,"objectID":"86f8eae8ad659f6525aae2d7bb559ce4","permalink":"/research/wisp/","publishdate":"2020-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/wisp/","section":"research","summary":"Assess uncertainties in the Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model inputs due to meteorological variables and improve model performance by calibrating parameters based on ground EC observations and satellite measurements","tags":["Actual evapotranspiration","Eddy Covariance","Longwave radiation","Emissivity","Bias"],"title":"Improving parameterization of atmospheric emissivity of a regional model for evapotranspiration estimation","type":"research"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Ankur R Desai (2020)"],"categories":null,"content":"Conference: ‘American Water Resource Association (AWRA) 44th Annual Conference 2020’\nAbstract: In our ability to sustain food production, it is important to know how much water our crops need.

About 2,290 high capacity groundwater (GW) wells in shallow sandy and gravel aquifer are being used to irrigate potatoes, sweet corn, peas and bean. These high capacity wells withdraw and pump about 100,000 gallons of water per day and are also draining streams and lakes. Changes in precipitation and temperature has also increased the length of growing season in WCS. Improved understanding of groundwater level response to climate patterns and pumping is essential for sustainable planning and management, particularly in the context of increasing groundwater demands in agriculture. As an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models, here we evaluate the reliability of a machine learning based GW model using environmental drivers to GW fluctuation. The objectives were to: 1) develop a new ensemble modeling framework based on artificial neural network nonlinear autoregressive networks to predict spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in WCS, and 2) determine the relative influence of climate variability, evapotranspiration (ET) and crop irrigation demand on GW level change. Precipitation and temperature, streamflow and other climatic indices were chosen as predictors, which make the selected approach easily transferable, since that data is widely available and simple to measure. We trained our model with input data in WCS from 2012-2015 and tested for 2016-2017. Our results show that at least for WCS, our modeling framework can serve as an alternative approach to simulating groundwater level change and water availability, especially in regions where subsurface properties are unknown. An easy to use and rapidly run model also benefits farmers who can identify areas where GW is depleting and thus avoid those regions or grow either non- irrigating crops or crops that recharge GW.Understanding the nonlinear relationship between climate, GW pumping and surface water is also crucial for scientist and conservation professionals, to help protect areas with potential for highest GW depletion. A future application of this work will be to predict crop yield by identifying the important drivers that affect GW level.\n","date":1544486400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544486400,"objectID":"ae0202d8a28becd076d2a9db8168eb49","permalink":"/conferences/efficacy-of-machine-learning-algorithms-2018/","publishdate":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/efficacy-of-machine-learning-algorithms-2018/","section":"Conferences","summary":"A new ensemble modeling framework based on artificial neural network nonlinear autoregressive networks was developed to predict spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in the densely irrigated area of Wisconsin central sands (WCS).","tags":["Stochastic hydrology","Hydrology Instruments and techniques","monitoring","Data mining-","Informatics","Machine learning"],"title":"Efficacy of Machine Learning Algorithms for Identifying Hotspots of Groundwater Depletion in Intensively Irrigated Agricultural Regions","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Mallika Arudi Nocco","Elizabeth O McNamee","Brian Bohman","Ammara Talib","Carl J Rosen","Ankur R Desai","Christel C Kern","Christopher J Kucharik","Tracy E Twine (2018)"],"categories":null,"content":"Conference: ‘American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2018, H11J-1598’\nAbstract: Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan are experiencing conversion from forests to irrigated potato and vegetable production in coarse soils overlying unconfined aquifers. Groundwater and surface water are strongly connected in these regions, where baseflow often exceeds 80% of streamflow. Watersheds that have already undergone heavy irrigated land use conversion (e.g., Wisconsin Central Sands) currently struggle with surface water loss and ecological degradation. Though it is well understood that forests provide regulatory ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge and nutrient filtration, the spatiotemporal changes to the hydrological budget associated with irrigated land use conversion across the northern Great Lakes states are unclear. Irrigation-induced depletion is a localized and episodic process in this humid region where precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration by 200-300 mm yr-1. Irrigated land use conversion may increase or decrease net annual groundwater recharge by 50 mm depending on the methodology (e.g., remote sensing vs. semi-empirical hydrological modeling) and spatial scale used to develop estimates. Policymakers and water managers require more information about how irrigated land use conversion changes the timing and magnitude of net groundwater recharge as well as the interannual variability associated with these changes. Our goal is to better understand historical and potential hydrological impacts of pine to potato conversion across the northern Great Lakes region. To this end, we developed and validated mid and late season potato plant functional types for the process-based AgroIBIS-VSF model using lysimetry, eddy covariance, phenological, and physiological data from several sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Using AgroIBIS-VSF, we examined how pine and mixed forest conversion to irrigated mid and late season potato agroecosystems altered monthly and annual groundwater recharge between 1979-2016. Preliminary results reveal significant interannual variability in groundwater recharge and potential tradeoffs between groundwater recharge and nutrient filtration ecosystem services.

However,stream channelization, past wetland drainage, and ground water withdrawals have disrupted the hydrology of this CentralSands region. Climatically driven conditions in last decade (2000-2008) alone are unable to account for the severelydepressed water levels. Increased interception and evapotranspiration from afforested areas in central sand Wisconsinmay also be culprit for reduced water recharge. Hence, there is need to study the cumulative effects of changingprecipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lakelevels and water availability in this region.Here, the SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale. The coupled model fullyintegrates a watershed model (SWAT) with a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Surface water and ground water flowswere simulated integratively at daily time step to estimate the groundwater discharge to the stream network in CentralSands that encompasses high capacity wells. The model was calibrated (2010-2013) and validated (2014-2017) based onstreamflow, groundwater extraction, and water table elevation. As the long-term trends in some of the primary drivers is presently ambiguous in Central Sands under future climate, as isthe case for total precipitation or timing of precipitation, we relied on a sensitivity student to quantitatively access howprimary and secondary drivers may influence future net groundwater recharge. We demonstrate how such an approachcould then be coupled with decision-making models to evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater withdrawal policiesunder a changing climate.\n","date":1513123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1513123200,"objectID":"0d856a35353ab23b20a252a9b491a46c","permalink":"/conferences/groundwater-surface-water-interaction-in-dense-network-of-high-capacity-wells-2017/","publishdate":"2017-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/conferences/groundwater-surface-water-interaction-in-dense-network-of-high-capacity-wells-2017/","section":"Conferences","summary":"The SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale to study the cumulative effects of changing precipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lake levels and water availability in agricultural regions.","tags":["Drought","Hydrology","Eco-hydrology","Floods","Water management","Coupled models"],"title":"Groundwater-Surface water interaction in agricultural watershed that encompasses dense network of High Capacity wells","type":"Conferences"},{"authors":["Ammara Talib","Timothy O.Randhir"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509494400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509494400,"objectID":"9c9796b38ace38db6182a0612ee4dbe4","permalink":"/publications/managing-emerging-contaminants-2017/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/managing-emerging-contaminants-2017/","section":"publications","summary":"We propose comprehensive management using sources, transfer and fate of emerging contaminants.
