      <title>Multidecadal evapotranspiration measurements in a temperate forest demonstrate a sustained impact of warmer winters and a transient effect of chronic biotic disturbance</title>

Over the past few decades, HWA infestation has significantly affected eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) in the eastern U.S., and winters are expected to continue to warm in the future. Direct ET measurements are particularly essential for managing forests as pressures on high-quality surface water supply increase. 
Our study investigates how forest disturbances, climate change, and ET interact to influence the water cycle in the eastern U.S., where surface water regeneration plays a critical role in local water supply systems. 
&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that the biotic stress and mortality by HWA at the eastern hemlock site would cause an initial decrease in ET followed by an increase as deciduous species replaced hemlock. We also expected to find larger shifts in ET in the non-growing season due to the stress and mortality of the evergreen hemlock trees,
coupled with increasingly warmer winter conditions that allow higher year-round transpiration. At both sites, we hypothesized that the meteorological drivers associated with PET would increase year-round due to higher temperatures and vapor pressure deficit with climate change.

&lt;p&gt;Figure demonstrates that both EMS and HEM tower shows a decline in ET in the initial time period. For example, ET has declined significantly (p=1.7^10-2) from 587.2 to 374.2 during 2003-2008 with a negative slope of -9.2 and percent change of 31.5%. HEM tower also showed a significant decline (p=2.9^10-1) in ET from 565.7 to 278.9 mm with a steep slope of -26 and percent change of 60.6%.
After an initial decline in ET at both sites, an increase in ET was observed for the later period of time series. For example, at EMS site, ET was slightly increased (p=6.9*10-1) from 374.2 to 464.5 mm with a slope of 4.1 and percent change of 12%. Similarly HEM site ET also increased from 278.9-424 with a slope of 3.3 and a change of 12%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The figure shows a significant decrease at a rate of -0.004 mol m-2 s-1 year-1 (38.6%) over this time period (Kendall τ = -0.34, p = 0.007). Time series trends for growing season gs paralleled those of the annual gs with a significant decrease at a rate of -0.006 mol m-2 per year (Kendall τ = -0.40, p = 0.002). At the EMS site the non-growing season gs did not have a significant trend through time.
A t-test found that the mean annual gs of 0.32 mol m-2 s-1 with a range of 0.22–0.42 mol m-2 s-1 (SD=0.05) for 2005-2023 was significantly lower than that of EMS (t-test, p = 2.24^10-16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the EMS site, NETRAD was identified as the most influential meteorological factor affecting ET, followed by month, GPP, VPD, and PAR. In contrast, at the HEM site, GPP was the most significant factor influencing ET, followed by NETRAD, NEE, VPD, and Tair.
The correlation between GPP and ET is stronger at the HEM site compared to the EMS site. Conversely, the importance of NETRAD is greater at the EMS site than at the HEM site.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Microscopy of Life, Biomedical Engineering 619, Final Project&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research project is a review of optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a non-invasive optical interferometric method for Parkinson’s disease diagnosis.
I am working on this review paper under the guidance of &lt;a href=&#34;https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/bme/faculty/eliceiri_kevin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Prof. Eliceiri&lt;/a&gt; in Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation lab &lt;a href=&#34;https://eliceirilab.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;LOCI&lt;/a&gt;. I hope to submit my review paper for this research project in Spring 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative movement disorders include Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD). Neurodegenerative processes, which affect the brain of PD patients, may also have negative effects on the retina. An optical coherence tomography image can be obtained in a non-invasive, quick, and cost-effective manner using optical interferometry.
Using this review, we will assess if retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) and retinal thickness (RT) differ between patients with PD and healthy individuals. The majority of reports indicate that RNFLT tends to be thinner in patients with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease, despite different studies providing conflicting results.
Figures above depict choroid and capillary changes in early-stage Parkinson’s disease.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to our review, PD patients had lower RNFLTg, nasal retinal segment (RTn), visual acuity (VA), and intraocular pressure (IOP) scores. It is possible that lower VA scores were caused by the thinning of the RNFLTg and RTn. Thus, future studies should evaluate the reason for lower IOP values in non-glaucomatous IPD patients, and more comprehensive studies should be performed on a larger population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final Project for Microbio 304 Lab:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, a bacterium is isolated from an organic lettuce sample and grown in YTG media. Physiological tests such as cellular morphology, glucose/lactose fermentation, motility catalase, oxidase test, tryptophanase test, etc. were used for bacterium identification. Then chromosomal DNA is isolated from the pure culture of our natural isolate, and PCR is used to amplify the 16S rRNA gene. The region is then sequenced and compared to all other known sequences to identify the strain. Based on physiological and molecular characterization, this research hypothesized that the bacterial strain in our natural isolate from the organic lettuce sample is Exiguobacterium undae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fermentation broth indicated a weakly positive result for fermentation of glucose or lactose. In motility media, nature isolate gave a positive test and was motile. Microbial strain is a facultative anaerobe and catalase positive. Nature isolate is rod-shaped and gram-positive. It is positive for starch hydrolysis and negative for enzyme tryptophanase and oxidase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agarose gel analysis for DNA electrophoresis showed that the correct single band of 1465 bp is amplified. Exiguobacterium undae is a motile, facultative anaerobe, gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria based on physiological test. It is oxidase negative and tryptophanase negative, weakly positive for glucose/sugar fermentation, positive for catalase and starch hydrolysis. In addition, 16s rRNA gene DNA sequence using BLAST also identified our nature isolate as Exiguobacterium undae.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organ regeneration capacity of some vertebrates, like fish and salamanders, depends on cell differentiation followed by proliferation. The goal of this review is to assess the effect of inducible expression of the four Yamanaka factors 4F specifically in hepatocytes. 4F in vivo expression transiently induced partial reprogramming of adult hepatocytes to a progenitor state and increased cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This effect was indicated by an increase in markers of proliferation, global changes in DNA accessibility and reduced expression of differentiated hepatic-lineage markers. These results show that using partial reprogramming, cellular plasticity can be induced, and liver failure can be counteracted suggesting an avenue for enhancing tissue regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Spatial and temporal Characterization of Forecasting GW Anomalies in Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS)</title>
      <link>/research/gw_anamoly/</link>

      <description>&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: justify;&#34;&gt;
Wisconsin is humid, though GW shortages have been reported in several regions, including the Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS). The shortage of GW in the WCS is caused by many factors, including climate variability, fast expansion of irrigation, increasing high-capacity wells, and increasing population. For sustainable 
water resource management, there is an urgent need to develop a computationally-efficient and easy-to-update  framework with the capability of efficient incorporation of recently developed and regularly updated environmental datasets (e.g., remote sensing maps of evapotranspiration and soil 
moisture).
&lt;p&gt;The research questions for this project include: Using computationally efficient ML models, can easy-to-obtain remote sensing derived environmental datasets be combined to accurately predict GW dynamics across the WCS? How does GW anomaly vary in space and across the WCS? How pumping and crop type change can influence this anomaly forecasting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static and dynamic variables were used to build LSTM model for
prediction of GW depth at the 26 well locations in the WCS region monthly from 1958 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of topography-related drivers is more conspicuous than SWE drivers. For example, for four wells, MAE was reduced by greater than 10 %, but for eight wells, MAE increased by greater than 10 %.
Additionally, these three wells with the highest % change in MAE were located on the northeast side of WCS. All drivers, except meteorology-associated drivers, increased MAE for well_4101 when excluded. Well_1701 MAE was also increased when other drivers were excluded except for topography-related drivers. Based on permutation feature importance, PDSI, SW radiation, soil moisture, wind speed, and runoff were among the most important features.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pumping or irrigation demand has a higher relative importance to GW anomalies forecast compared to land use change.
There is a direct connection between pumping and groundwater level change based on simple physics, but initially, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear whether irrigation demand would have a more substantial impact on groundwater anomalies than land use change since land use changes determine irrigation demand because of their correlation. Groundwater dynamics are closely related to agricultural irrigation in the WCS.

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our observations, negative anomaly means shallow GW, so pumping has greater influence on shallow GW. Hence model can better estimate anomaly for shallower water. Pumping makes GW deeper so the anomaly becomes positive.
I hope to submit my manuscript for this research project by January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Genome-wide association study (GWAS) and Candidate Associated study in Uruguay Population to identify common and novel susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Population Genetics 633: Final Research Proposal for class&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the largest epidemics of the 21st century is type-2 diabetes (T2D), a chronic disease characterized by a decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin. Uruguay is a unique population for not carrying out genome-wide association study (GWAS) even though they have an increased susceptibility to diabetes and have increased insulin resistance. The specific objective of this research is: 1) to identify common genetic variants underlying the risk of T2D in the Uruguay population using GWAS and 2) to test provisory implicated genes in T2D using a candidate gene association study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For objective one, stage one of the GEWAS approach includes a GWAS scan on alleles with SNP call rate &amp;gt;95% (minor allele frequency &amp;gt;1%) in Uruguay Population with 5,450 cases with T2D 12,550 controls. Then in stage two, replication testing of 20-30 SNPs will be done, followed by sequencing, linkage disequilibrium structure analysis and eQTLs in stage three. Another approach in this study for objective 2 includes a candidate genes association study based on T2D-associated genes from literature (Barroso et al., 2003) using 500 cases and controls. First, SNPs and haplotypes associated with diseases will be identified and tested using a genetic Model showing association with disease in a case-control study. Then we will test SNPs and Haplotypes associated with Disease in QT scenarios of body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results of this research proposal can shed light on whether there was heterogeneity of effect between the Uruguay population and other Europeans. We expect some loci to show a consistent direction of effect in the Uruguay population and Europeans and the remaining loci to be associated with T2D at P &amp;lt; 0.05 in only the Uruguay population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Long-running eddy covariance towers help provide the statistically robust insights into how the carbon cycle operates over multiple time-scales, across multiple climate extremes, disturbances, and during longterm trends in atmospheric composition. Long-running eddy covariance towers operating as a cluster provide an even stronger case for evaluating how processes that impact the carbon cycle vary across ecosystem properties, within the same climate and biome. Here, we present a lab initiated project to harmonize and evaluate variation in net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide across the Chequamegon Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (ChEAS) Ameriflux core site cluster in the upper Great Lakes region USA. The tower network includes two mature hardwood forests with differing management regimes (US-WCr and US-Syv), two fen wetlands with varying exposure and vegetation (US-Los and US-ALQ), and a very tall (400 m) landscape level tower (US-PFa) that has been in continuous operation for eddy covariance since 1996. Together, they provide over 70 site-years of observations that can be coupled to climate drivers and remotely-sensed vegetation function. Short-term seasonal to 4-year studies of additional tower clusters in wetlands, forests of differing successional stage, and the 19-tower CHEESEHEAD19 campaign provide additional context on spatial variation. One remarkable consistent finding is the strong role that water, whether in atmosphere (VPD), soil, stream, or water table plays in modulating carbon flux variation, despite a general overall lack of water-limitation in the biome.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Diabetes care disparities among African Americans and Intervention to reduce disparities</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final Project for courses:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Health Communication in the Information Age (LSC 617)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication Arts, Race and Health Communication (COM ARTS 612)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with diabetes are more likely to report a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than those without diabetes. African Americans have the highest incidence of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke, tend to be younger at the time of first stroke event, and their strokes tend to be more severe with higher morbidity and result in higher mortality. The causes of health disparities are complex and include societal issues such as institutional racism, discrimination, socioeconomic status, poor access to health care lack of health insurance, poor understanding of the relationship between obesity, diabetes, and CVD among low-income African American communities. In addition, community-level barriers, such as limited access to supermarkets with healthy food items, can lead to unhealthy dietary habits. However, the prevalence of these chronic diseases across racial groups cannot be solely explained by socioeconomic status. Regardless of the ability to speak and understand English, speaking a language other than English at home confers a higher risk for not receiving appropriate health care. Therefore, changes at the policy level for equal access to high-quality care are paramount to reducing health care disparities. Higher morbidity and mortality rates caused by CVD and diabetes can lead to higher care costs in patients and a disproportionate burden on African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher morbidity and mortality rates caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes can lead to higher care costs in patients, and a disproportionate burden is on minorities. Therefore, addressing the causes of these disparities and utilizing intervention to control CVD and diabetes in one of the largest minority groups in the US, i.e., African Americans, can potentially decrease healthcare costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to assess the causes of diabetes and CVD health disparities among African populations and investigate what intervention are out there to mitigate disparities. These disparities other than SES include patient provider relationship (implicit biases), medical mistrust and community level barriers. Centuries of racial discrimination led to medical mistrust among African Americans and lingering effects persists decades after Tuskegee Syphilis Study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We explored interventions to mitigate these disparities. Those interventions include improving access to care and quality of care. Interventions to eliminate the Black-White disparity in CVD and diabetes control would avert thousands of deaths from CVD in Black Americans. These CVD and diabetes disparities indicate underlying variations in health behavior, medical treatments and need to evaluate causes of these difference and targeted intervention efforts. The health care disparities trends have implications for policy makers, public health practitioners and clinicians to move towards cardiovascular health equity for African Americans. Addressing the causes of these disparities and proposing intervention can decrease health care costs and burden for African Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HPV-11 and HPV-6 are low-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cause benign anogenital warts that usually do not become cancerous. They have been shown to bind to pRB.
HPV-16 and HPV-18 are high-risk HPVs. They cause lesions that often result in cervical carcinomas and have been shown to bind to pRB. HPV-16 E6 can bind to p53 but HPV-16 E7 cannot bind to p53. Only E6 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 were binding to human p53 protein. E6 of HPV-16 twice as likely to bind as E6 of HPV-18.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cells infected with HPV-16 and HPV-18 , there is no detectable amount of p53 protein. E6 protein may degrade wild-type p53, destroying its functionality as a tumor suppressor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The E6 Oncoprotein Encoded by Human Papillomavirus Type 16 and 18 Promotes the Degradation of p53. Presence of HPV-18 E6 leads to in vitro degradation of p53. Once p53 molecules were targeted, degradation occurred rapidly and completely.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine learning data-driven network to estimate and forecast evapotranspiration (ET)</title>

The potentials of random forest (RF) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to estimate and forecast daily ET for corn, soybeans, and potatoes in diverse agricultural farms was evaluated in this research. The proposed modeling architecture provides a field-scale, locally calibrated tool for accurate prediction and short-term forecasting of daily ET in areas lacking in situ ET, metrological, and biophysical data. Furthermore, since there is no clear understanding of minimum required predictors for accurate estimates of ET, our models with different sets of predictors can help to understand the need for essential or minimum drivers for different crop fields on various soil textures in areas with scarce data. 
&lt;p&gt;The goals of this research include, how well can empirical ML models predict and forecast ET 3 days in advance in irrigated and rain-fed agricultural lands across the Midwest US? And What are important drivers for predicting and forecasting ET 3 days in advance in irrigated and non-irrigated areas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prediction and forecasting models for ET based on RF and LSTM framework with 5, 11, and 16 predictors was proposed. For all model experiments, simulations were based on daily time step from 2003-2019. The selection of sixteen model input predictors for RF_16 and LSTM_16 model was due to their influence on ET and their availability for agricultural sites. After calibration and validation, empirical models of RF and LSTM were benchmarked against output from process-based model ET from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) version 2 LSM model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the two ET prediction algorithms for the test data, which demonstrated the ability of the calibrated models to generalize to unseen ET observations (test data) from eddy covariance flux towers across multiple crop types. The evaluation statistics indicated that there is a good agreement between the predicted and observed ET values across corn, soybeans, and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our analysis for RF model showed that VP and crop coefficients were the most important predictors for irrigated crops, while short wave radiation and enhanced vegetation index were key predictors for non-irrigated crops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A multistep forecast model that can forecast ET three days ahead of time using RF and LSTM models was developed. Finally, the importance of model predictors was calculated for both prediction and forecast model versions of RF.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conference: &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2020,&lt;/em&gt; H165-000&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In our ability to sustain food production, it is important to know how much water our crops use. The risks of climate extremes such as heat waves and droughts are increasing and have already threatened the North American agricultural system in the form of increased drought duration, intensity, and reduced crop yield. Current drought prediction models cover large regions and are not specific to individual farms. The goal of this study is 1) Forecast field-scale short-term evapotranspiration (ET) for different crops in the U.S. Midwest and 2) improve a commonly used satellite-driven regional crop evapotranspiration model (WISP). The first goal is achieved by building a prediction and forecasting empirical model based on machine learning. We compare two approaches, neural networks with Long short-term memory (LSTM) and random forest (RF) applied to nineteen crop sites in a range of crop types, soils, and irrigation usage that have continuous ET measurements made by eddy covariance. In general, performance of RF exceeded LSTM in most cases and forecasts were found to be reliable out to three days. Unlike rainfed crops, we found irrigated crops ET prediction requires including additional information related to physical properties of sites (soil types, crop coefficient, cumulative growing degree days). For the second goal, we evaluated ET predictions from WISP against some of these towers. Overestimation of ET in WISP arises from faulty parameterization of longwave radiation clear-sky emissivity. We applied an inverse approach to estimate corrected clear sky emissivity parameters. ET calculated based on corrected parameters reduced most of the model’s ET bias and lowered RMSE. New field-scale actual ET measurements provide critical insights to improve ET models and hence, enhance drought monitoring and forecasting necessary to be able to use limited water resources efficiently to maintain productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conference: &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2020,&lt;/em&gt; H021-06&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: A key challenge for bridging precision irrigation research and application is how best to monitor evapotranspiration (ET) and water stress in real-time. Eddy Covariance towers and lysimeters are vetted methods of monitoring ET and water stress but can lack field-size domains, spatial resolution, and be cost prohibitive. Remotely sensed data offer a potential solution to this problem. However, aerial and satellite imagery have the drawback of spatiotemporal resolution and cloud interference. Recent advancements in remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) have made frequent, low-flying optical and thermal imagery collection more economical and feasible than ever before. While low flight elevations improve image resolution and can reduce cloud interference, they require more imagery to cover a field and therefore increase battery usage and post-processing needs. In order to find the optimal RPA flight elevation for irrigation management, the goal of this study is to evaluate the influence of capture elevation on modeled ET values.
The goal of our project was to evaluate the influence of capture elevation on modeled evapotranspiration values. The optical and thermal data were collected from a commercially irrigated potato field in the Wisconsin Central Sands during the 2019 growing season. A total of eight mission sets were flown. Each mission set was flown using a quadcopter RPA system and combined multispectral/thermal camera. Mission sets included flights at 90, 60, and 30 m above ground level. Ground measurements of surface temperature and soil moisture were collected throughout the domain within 15 minutes of each RPA mission set. ET values were modeled from the flight data using the High-Resolution Mapping of Evapotranspiration (HRMET) model. HRMET-derived ET maps are compared to ET estimates from an Eddy Covariance system within the flight domain. Ongoing results will be used to develop best practices and assess trade-offs for integrating RPAs as decision support tools for irrigation and water management.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final project for Anatomy &amp;amp; Physiology 338 Human Anatomy Laboratory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Objectives:
Our review hypothesizes that scoliosis affects the pulmonary function in children. Early spinal fusion from scoliosis also affects lung growth in young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In patients with scoliosis, forced expiratory volume in one second was only 27 % of normal values. It also diminished maximum inspiratory pressure, caused chest weakness and hypercarbia&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Improving parameterization of atmospheric emissivity of a regional model for evapotranspiration estimation</title>
      <link>/research/wisp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first chapter of my thesis seeks to improve the parameterization of atmospheric emissivity of a regional irrigation scheduling program for evapotranspiration estimation using eddy covariance measurements. The performance of land surface model-based AET, reanalysis, and remote sensing products varies at different spatio-temporal scales. In the Central Sands Regions of Wisconsin, irrigation agriculture plays a fundamental role in supporting regional agricultural production and rural community development. For irrigation scheduling, farmers often rely on the Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model, developed by soil scientists at UW-Madison and based on satellite data. WISP is a regional model based on the Priestley Taylor approach and provides Potential ET (PET) estimates that can be scaled to ET based on percent canopy cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2018, with support from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wisconsinpotatoes.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Growers Association&lt;/a&gt; Water Task Force, &lt;a href=&#34;https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/Groundwater/GCC/research.htm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources&lt;/a&gt;, and the UW &lt;a href=&#34;https://ccr.nelson.wisc.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Center for Climatic Research&lt;/a&gt;, our lab installed eddy covariance flux towers on a center-pivot irrigated potato field (US-CS1) from June 2018-May 2019, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tricounty.k12.wi.us/district/schoolforest.cfm&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Tri-County School Forest&lt;/a&gt; pine stand Sept 2018-, a 2nd potato field (US-CS3) from June 2019-June 2020, and a 3rd potato field (US-CS4) from June 2020-present. Links to graphs, tables, and publications are at project website [Water use in Wisconsin Potatoes and Pine] (&lt;a href=&#34;https://flux.aos.wisc.edu/potato&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://flux.aos.wisc.edu/potato&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research evaluates sources of bias in the WISP model and develops a correction using eddy covariance (EC) observations. AET observations were made for five years (2018–2022), using EC systems in irrigated potatoes fields in Wisconsin Central Sands (WCS) region. Multi-source ET datasets should be employed in future studies to enhance confidence in remotely sensed ET related water budgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of uncertainty in the model could be due to model inputs of coefficients used in empirical equations. Those coefficients are not regionally calibrated, which could lead to underestimating the energy budget.
Wisconsin is humid, where ET is energy limited, and by correcting the energy budget, we expect to see reduced bias in model ET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The WISP model
overestimated ET before correction because modeled AET range for the WCS region was 7.17-7.48 mm before correction for July 19th, 2020, but after correction modeled
AET_corr range was 5.59-5.86 mm. Total AET for the entire region for July 19th, 2020, is 569 mm before correction and 444.5 mm after modification, with a difference of 124.5 mm.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conference: &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;American Water Resource Association (AWRA) 44th Annual Conference 2020&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In our ability to sustain food production, it is important to know how much water our crops need. The risks of climate extremes such as heat waves and droughts are increasing and have already threatened the north Central America agricultural system in form of increased drought duration, intensity and reduced crop yield. Agricultural vulnerability can be reduced through advanced monitoring of agricultural water consumptive use and improved drought estimation. The goal, of this research is 1) to calculate the water use efficiency of different potato varieties 2) comparison of water use between potatoes and pines. These goals are achieved by comparing ET and soil moisture data from eddy covariance flux towers and soil moisture sensors installed in irrigated Heartland and pine forest in Tri-county of WI. The data comparison between potatoes and pine ET shows that when there is a big rainfall or irrigation event, the differences between already available ET measurement based on remote sensing models and actual ET measurements are small. However, when soil is dry, ET measurement from Eddy covariance flux tower are more accurate. In addition, the soil moisture and ET comparison provides insight about coupling between soil moisture and ET. New field-scale actual ET measurement will provide deep insights and indicate when plants are under stress and farmers can take actions and use limited water resources efficiently to maintain productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pines are wetter on the surface. But later the difference between pine and potatoes soil moisture decreases. Pines have more transpiration and less soil evaporation. Deeper in the ground (around 18 inches depth) potatoes have more soil moisture. Water use by different crop types in Midwest (2017,2018) was compared under different soil types. Even same crop type can lead to different water used based on soil condition. Cumulatively corn water loss in Illinois (IL) was about four inches higher than WI potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In our ability to sustain food production, it is important to know how much water our crops need. Current drought forecasts cover large regions and are not specific to individual farms. Here, we seek to improve forecasting of how crops drought stress changes over time during different stages of growth through advanced mapping and modeling of evapotranspiration (ET) with NASA space borne sensors. We developed an algorithm that can accurately predict and forecast farm-scale regional daily out to 3 days. We use these forecasts to determine what varieties of a crops use less water or what varieties are best performing under water stress conditions. We hypothesized that thermal products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and meteorological information provide the resolution and temporal repeat frequency necessary to develop ET products. These goals were accomplished by forecasting water demand (ET loss) by crops with help of ensemble machine learning algorithms with use of meteorological data, MODIS products and ground observation from flux towers. From these products, we developed, calibrated and evaluated a new crop ET product against field measurements of ET from a network of crop eddy covariance flux towers in Midwest USA. These towers are currently operating in irrigated and rain fed field corn, soybean, wheat, clover and potato farms under a range of water management strategies. Daily ET forecast (3 days) model based on random forest (RF) has R2 and RMSE of 0.72 mm and 0.76mm respectively while recurrent neural network (RNN) ensemble forecast model was able to forecast 3 days ET with R2 and RMSE of 0.71 mm and 0.78 mm respectively. New field-scale ET maps can provide deep insights into how farmers could use limited water resources efficiently to maintain productivity, while sustaining surface water resources in the face of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Groundwater depletion in Central Wisconsin, due in part to agricultural high-capacity wells, has sparked an interest in precision irrigation to reduce groundwater pumping without a significant reduction in yield. A key challenge for bridging precision irrigation research and application is how best to monitor water stress in real-time. Aerial and satellite imagery are potential solutions. Drawbacks of these methods include cost, spatiotemporal resolution, and cloud interference, especially in humid regions. Recent advancements in remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) have made frequent, low-flying imagery collection more economical and feasible than ever before. We partnered with the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Grower Association to generate high-resolution maps of crop water stress using remotely sensed thermal and multi-spectral RPA imagery. Data were collected at a commercially irrigated potato field in the Central Sands region of Wisconsin from June to August 2019. Missions were flown weekly using a quadcopter RPA system instrumented with a newly released, combined multispectral/thermal camera developed for agricultural applications. Each mission included flights at 30, 60, and 90 m above ground level to assess tradeoffs between resolution, area, and flight time. We used biophysical data from an eddy covariance system installed within the flight domain to validate crop water stress maps generated from the remotely sensed RPA data. Ground measurements of surface temperature and soil moisture were collected throughout the domain within fifteen minutes of each mission. Ongoing results will be used to develop best practices for integrating RPAs into precision irrigation programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ways to measure ET:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meteorological approximations: Thornthwaite, Priestly-Taylor, Penman-Montieth – Strong assumptions on surface properties, ET driven by radiation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Residual: Measure precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, back out ET – Subject to high uncertainty Lysimeters: Labor-intensive, small-area estimate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote sensing:  Assumptions on links between electromagnetic radiation and ET, satellites don’t work with clouds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process models: Captures all aspects but requires extensive, hard to measure parameters&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eddy covariance: Direct method, whole field, expensive and expertise required&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Machine “Learning”: Site-specific, hard to extrapolate or interpret, but powerful for forecasting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Efficacy of Machine Learning Algorithms for Identifying Hotspots of Groundwater Depletion in Intensively Irrigated Agricultural Regions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conference: &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2018,&lt;/em&gt; H21J-1787&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The Central Sands region of Wisconsin is one of the most agriculturally productive regions of the United States because of supplemental irrigation with groundwater. About 2,290 high capacity groundwater (GW) wells in shallow sandy and gravel aquifer are being used to irrigate potatoes, sweet corn, peas and bean. These high capacity wells withdraw and pump about 100,000 gallons of water per day and are also draining streams and lakes. Changes in precipitation and temperature has also increased the length of growing season in WCS. Improved understanding of groundwater level response to climate patterns and pumping is essential for sustainable planning and management, particularly in the context of increasing groundwater demands in agriculture. As an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models, here we evaluate the reliability of a machine learning based GW model using environmental drivers to GW fluctuation. The objectives were to: 1) develop a new ensemble modeling framework based on artificial neural network nonlinear autoregressive networks to predict spatio-temporal fluctuations of groundwater in WCS, and 2) determine the relative influence of climate variability, evapotranspiration (ET) and crop irrigation demand on GW level change. Precipitation and temperature, streamflow and other climatic indices were chosen as predictors, which make the selected approach easily transferable, since that data is widely available and simple to measure. We trained our model with input data in WCS from 2012-2015 and tested for 2016-2017. Our results show that at least for WCS, our modeling framework can serve as an alternative approach to simulating groundwater level change and water availability, especially in regions where subsurface properties are unknown. An easy to use and rapidly run model also benefits farmers who can identify areas where GW is depleting and thus avoid those regions or grow either non- irrigating crops or crops that recharge GW.Understanding the nonlinear relationship between climate, GW pumping and surface water is also crucial for scientist and conservation professionals, to help protect areas with potential for highest GW depletion. A future application of this work will be to predict crop yield by identifying the important drivers that affect GW level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pine to Potato Conversion Impacts to Groundwater Recharge in the Northern Great Lakes Region</title>
      <link>/conferences/groundwater-recharge-in-the-northern-great-lakes-region-2018/</link>

      <guid>/conferences/groundwater-recharge-in-the-northern-great-lakes-region-2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conference: &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;American Geophysical Union, Fall Meeting 2018,&lt;/em&gt; H11J-1598&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan are experiencing conversion from forests to irrigated potato and vegetable production in coarse soils overlying unconfined aquifers. Groundwater and surface water are strongly connected in these regions, where baseflow often exceeds 80% of streamflow. Watersheds that have already undergone heavy irrigated land use conversion (e.g., Wisconsin Central Sands) currently struggle with surface water loss and ecological degradation. Though it is well understood that forests provide regulatory ecosystem services such as groundwater recharge and nutrient filtration, the spatiotemporal changes to the hydrological budget associated with irrigated land use conversion across the northern Great Lakes states are unclear. Irrigation-induced depletion is a localized and episodic process in this humid region where precipitation exceeds potential evapotranspiration by 200-300 mm yr-1. Irrigated land use conversion may increase or decrease net annual groundwater recharge by 50 mm depending on the methodology (e.g., remote sensing vs. semi-empirical hydrological modeling) and spatial scale used to develop estimates. Policymakers and water managers require more information about how irrigated land use conversion changes the timing and magnitude of net groundwater recharge as well as the interannual variability associated with these changes.
Our goal is to better understand historical and potential hydrological impacts of pine to potato conversion across the northern Great Lakes region. To this end, we developed and validated mid and late season potato plant functional types for the process-based AgroIBIS-VSF model using lysimetry, eddy covariance, phenological, and physiological data from several sites in Wisconsin and Minnesota. Using AgroIBIS-VSF, we examined how pine and mixed forest conversion to irrigated mid and late season potato agroecosystems altered monthly and annual groundwater recharge between 1979-2016. Preliminary results reveal significant interannual variability in groundwater recharge and potential tradeoffs between groundwater recharge and nutrient filtration ecosystem services. Results of this work will inform both top-down and bottom-up water management and conservation efforts at the farm, watershed, and statewide scales.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Water from ground to sky - New approaches to observing and predicting field to basin scale Evapotranspiration (ET) over crops and plantations</title>

&lt;p&gt;How reliable are fluxtowers?
As long as sample area is homogenous and uptime is good, eddy covariance is the gold standard for field-regional ET&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flux towers have pros/cons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PROS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to deploy on a tripod in a field, on solar power&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No moving parts, and mostly off-the-shelf technology&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly 500 long running sites worldwide&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“gold standard”. It is one of the only ways to directly measure ET at hourly time scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the same time, we also measure the surface heat exchange, carbon dioxide flux (productivity), and climate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CONS:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is relatively expensive (total around $40-50K to purchase)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requires significant expertise (technical personnel), and regular maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EC measures only upwind of the tower and when the atmosphere is “turbulent”, requiring application of methods to fill in data gaps and quality control data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Groundwater-Surface water interaction in agricultural watershed that encompasses dense network of High Capacity wells</title>

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The Central Sands region of Wisconsin is characterized by productive trout streams, lakes, farmland and forest. However,stream channelization, past wetland drainage, and ground water withdrawals have disrupted the hydrology of this CentralSands region. Climatically driven conditions in last decade (2000-2008) alone are unable to account for the severelydepressed water levels. Increased interception and evapotranspiration from afforested areas in central sand Wisconsinmay also be culprit for reduced water recharge. Hence, there is need to study the cumulative effects of changingprecipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lakelevels and water availability in this region.Here, the SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale. The coupled model fullyintegrates a watershed model (SWAT) with a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Surface water and ground water flowswere simulated integratively at daily time step to estimate the groundwater discharge to the stream network in CentralSands that encompasses high capacity wells. The model was calibrated (2010-2013) and validated (2014-2017) based onstreamflow, groundwater extraction, and water table elevation. As the long-term trends in some of the primary drivers is presently ambiguous in Central Sands under future climate, as isthe case for total precipitation or timing of precipitation, we relied on a sensitivity student to quantitatively access howprimary and secondary drivers may influence future net groundwater recharge. We demonstrate how such an approachcould then be coupled with decision-making models to evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater withdrawal policiesunder a changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conference: &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;69th SWCS International Annual Conference- Making Waves in CONSERVATION 2014&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Changes in land use land cover (LULC) impact watersheds. Changes in rate of interception, evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration, and runoff have impacts on soil loss and nutrient loads into water bodies. Hence, there is a need to evaluate the influences of LULC on watershed systems in order to develop effective conservation policies. This study aims to model these effects using LULC change as a driver of watershed processes. This study is conducted in Sudbury, Assabet and Concord (SuAsCo) watershed in Massachusetts that has high runoff, and water quality impacts from sediments and nutrients loading. A calibrated watershed model (HSPF) is used to simulate water flows and water quality changes and validated using field data. Regional built-out scenarios of LULC changes are used to assess watershed wide impacts. Results indicate that changes in LULC significantly affect water flows and water quality. There is a potential for reducing runoff, sediments and nutrients loads by using conservation strategies such as carefully selected best management practices (BMPs), cost sharing and spatially targeted incentives. This study provides valuable information to watershed managers and landowners for protecting those watershed systems that are undergoing LULC changes like rapid urbanization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Watershed hydrologic processes and water quality is significantly influenced by changes in land use land cover (LULC) and climate change. Changes in rate of Interception, evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration, and runoff have impacts on soil loss and nutrient loads in watershed. Hence, there is a need to evaluate combined influences of LULC and climate change on watershed system for developing effective conservation policies. This study aims to model these synergistic effects using LULC change and climate change as drivers of watershed system. Study is done in Sudbury, Assabet and Concord (SuAsCo) watershed in Massachusetts that has runoff, and high levels of sediments and nutrients loading issues. A watershed simulation model (HSPF) is used to simulate hydrologic processes and water quality changes and is calibrated and validated using field-measured data. Downscaled regional projections from Global Climate Model (GCM) models and a regional built out scenarios of LULC are used to assess the impacts of projected LULC and climate change. The results indicate that the simultaneous changes in LULC and climate significantly affect the water resources in the SuAsCo river watershed. There is a potential for reducing runoff, sediments and nutrients loads by using conservation strategies such as best management practices (BMPs), cost sharing and incentives. This study provides valuable information to watershed managers and landowners about protecting those watershed systems that are undergoing urbanization and climate impacts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Climate change significantly influences watershed hydrologic processes. These changes influence the rate of interception; evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration, and runoff have impact on soil loss and nutrient loads into water bodies. Therefore, assessment of these influences on watershed system to develop comprehensive conservation policies is needed. This study aims to model the impacts using climate change on water quantity and water quality. The research is conducted in Sudbury, Assabet and Concord (SuAsCo) watershed of Massachusetts that is predicted to experience these impacts resulting in runoff issues and water quality impacts, especially increase in sediment and nutrients loading. A watershed simulation model (HSPF) is used to simulate watershed processes. The model is calibrated and validated by using field data from MassDEP. Nash-Sutcliffe equation is used to assess the efficiency of the model. A downscaled prediction of global climate models (GCMs) is used to assess climate change. Results indicate that changes in climate can significantly affect storm water flows and impact water quality both individually and in combination. There is a potential for reducing impacts of runoff, sediments and nutrients loads by using watershed conservation strategies. Climate adaptation strategies could involve implementation of low impact development practices and spatially targeted mitigation measures. Results provide valuable information to watershed managers and landowners for adaptation to climate change impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
