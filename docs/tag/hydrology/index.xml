&lt;p&gt;Abstract: In our ability to sustain food production, it is important to know how much water our crops need. Current drought forecasts cover large regions and are not specific to individual farms. Here, we seek to improve forecasting of how crops drought stress changes over time during different stages of growth through advanced mapping and modeling of evapotranspiration (ET) with NASA space borne sensors. We developed an algorithm that can accurately predict and forecast farm-scale regional daily out to 3 days. We use these forecasts to determine what varieties of a crops use less water or what varieties are best performing under water stress conditions. We hypothesized that thermal products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and meteorological information provide the resolution and temporal repeat frequency necessary to develop ET products. These goals were accomplished by forecasting water demand (ET loss) by crops with help of ensemble machine learning algorithms with use of meteorological data, MODIS products and ground observation from flux towers. From these products, we developed, calibrated and evaluated a new crop ET product against field measurements of ET from a network of crop eddy covariance flux towers in Midwest USA. These towers are currently operating in irrigated and rain fed field corn, soybean, wheat, clover and potato farms under a range of water management strategies. Daily ET forecast (3 days) model based on random forest (RF) has R2 and RMSE of 0.72 mm and 0.76mm respectively while recurrent neural network (RNN) ensemble forecast model was able to forecast 3 days ET with R2 and RMSE of 0.71 mm and 0.78 mm respectively. New field-scale ET maps can provide deep insights into how farmers could use limited water resources efficiently to maintain productivity, while sustaining surface water resources in the face of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using remotely piloted aircrafts to evaluate potato water stress in Central Wisconsin</title>

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: Groundwater depletion in Central Wisconsin, due in part to agricultural high-capacity wells, has sparked an interest in precision irrigation to reduce groundwater pumping without a significant reduction in yield. A key challenge for bridging precision irrigation research and application is how best to monitor water stress in real-time. Aerial and satellite imagery are potential solutions. Drawbacks of these methods include cost, spatiotemporal resolution, and cloud interference, especially in humid regions. Recent advancements in remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs) have made frequent, low-flying imagery collection more economical and feasible than ever before. We partnered with the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Grower Association to generate high-resolution maps of crop water stress using remotely sensed thermal and multi-spectral RPA imagery. Data were collected at a commercially irrigated potato field in the Central Sands region of Wisconsin from June to August 2019. Missions were flown weekly using a quadcopter RPA system instrumented with a newly released, combined multispectral/thermal camera developed for agricultural applications. Each mission included flights at 30, 60, and 90 m above ground level to assess tradeoffs between resolution, area, and flight time. We used biophysical data from an eddy covariance system installed within the flight domain to validate crop water stress maps generated from the remotely sensed RPA data. Ground measurements of surface temperature and soil moisture were collected throughout the domain within fifteen minutes of each mission. Ongoing results will be used to develop best practices for integrating RPAs into precision irrigation programs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Groundwater-Surface water interaction in agricultural watershed that encompasses dense network of High Capacity wells</title>

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The Central Sands region of Wisconsin is characterized by productive trout streams, lakes, farmland and forest. However,stream channelization, past wetland drainage, and ground water withdrawals have disrupted the hydrology of this CentralSands region. Climatically driven conditions in last decade (2000-2008) alone are unable to account for the severelydepressed water levels. Increased interception and evapotranspiration from afforested areas in central sand Wisconsinmay also be culprit for reduced water recharge. Hence, there is need to study the cumulative effects of changingprecipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lakelevels and water availability in this region.Here, the SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale. The coupled model fullyintegrates a watershed model (SWAT) with a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Surface water and ground water flowswere simulated integratively at daily time step to estimate the groundwater discharge to the stream network in CentralSands that encompasses high capacity wells. The model was calibrated (2010-2013) and validated (2014-2017) based onstreamflow, groundwater extraction, and water table elevation. As the long-term trends in some of the primary drivers is presently ambiguous in Central Sands under future climate, as isthe case for total precipitation or timing of precipitation, we relied on a sensitivity student to quantitatively access howprimary and secondary drivers may influence future net groundwater recharge. We demonstrate how such an approachcould then be coupled with decision-making models to evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater withdrawal policiesunder a changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;
