Abstract: Given the climate crisis and the rapid global loss of biodiversity, it is essential to examine how climate change affects various aspects of forests and the water cycle. In the eastern United States, water dynamics in forest ecosystems have been notably influenced by moderate to severe forest disturbances over the past few decades. Alterations in canopy structure and complexity introduce significant uncertainty in predicting hydrological responses, particularly concerning evapotranspiration (ET) dynamics and streamflow patterns. This study seeks to investigate the interactions between forest disturbance, climate change, and ET in shaping the water cycle in the eastern US, where local water supply systems heavily rely on surface water regeneration. The objectives of this study are to quantify the short-term and long-term changes in ET, and develop a data-driven ET model by integrating long-term ecological and atmospheric observations to identify key drivers. We propose creating a data-driven ET model specific to the eastern US, incorporating long-term ecological and atmospheric data, and validating the results using eddy covariance ecosystem-atmosphere flux observations. Micrometeorological measurements from long-term weather stations and flux towers will be employed to estimate the water budget. This research aims to identify the key drivers of ET and streamflow anomalies in the eastern US and model regional responses. Additionally, this study will explore the role of physical and biological drivers on ET and streamflow dynamics in forest ecosystems and the impact of changing ET dynamics on the regional climate system.

&lt;p&gt;Abstract: The Central Sands region of Wisconsin is characterized by productive trout streams, lakes, farmland and forest. However,stream channelization, past wetland drainage, and ground water withdrawals have disrupted the hydrology of this CentralSands region. Climatically driven conditions in last decade (2000-2008) alone are unable to account for the severelydepressed water levels. Increased interception and evapotranspiration from afforested areas in central sand Wisconsinmay also be culprit for reduced water recharge. Hence, there is need to study the cumulative effects of changingprecipitation patterns, groundwater withdrawals, and forest evapotranspiration to improve projections of the future of lakelevels and water availability in this region.Here, the SWAT-MODFLOW coupled model approach was applied at large spatio-temporal scale. The coupled model fullyintegrates a watershed model (SWAT) with a groundwater flow model (MODFLOW). Surface water and ground water flowswere simulated integratively at daily time step to estimate the groundwater discharge to the stream network in CentralSands that encompasses high capacity wells. The model was calibrated (2010-2013) and validated (2014-2017) based onstreamflow, groundwater extraction, and water table elevation. As the long-term trends in some of the primary drivers is presently ambiguous in Central Sands under future climate, as isthe case for total precipitation or timing of precipitation, we relied on a sensitivity student to quantitatively access howprimary and secondary drivers may influence future net groundwater recharge. We demonstrate how such an approachcould then be coupled with decision-making models to evaluate the effectiveness of groundwater withdrawal policiesunder a changing climate.&lt;/p&gt;
