summary: HPV-18 E6 may act catalytically for p53 degradation. Targeted degradation of p53 by the E6 oncoproteins encoded by the “high risk” HPVs would account for the lowered levels of p53 protein found in some of the cervical carcinoma cell lines and HPV-immortalized squamous epithelial cell lines.

HPV-11 and HPV-6 are low-risk Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and cause benign anogenital warts that usually do not become cancerous. They have been shown to bind to pRB. 
HPV-16 and HPV-18 are high-risk HPVs. They cause lesions that often result in cervical carcinomas and have been shown to bind to pRB. HPV-16 E6 can bind to p53 but HPV-16 E7 cannot bind to p53. Only E6 proteins of HPV-16 and HPV-18 were binding to human p53 protein. E6 of HPV-16 twice as likely to bind as E6 of HPV-18.

In cells infected with HPV-16 and HPV-18 , there is no detectable amount of p53 protein. E6 protein may degrade wild-type p53, destroying its functionality as a tumor suppressor. 

The E6 Oncoprotein Encoded by Human Papillomavirus Type 16 and 18 Promotes the Degradation of p53. Presence of HPV-18 E6 leads to in vitro degradation of p53. Once p53 molecules were targeted, degradation occurred rapidly and completely.

•	Wild-type p53 gene have tumor suppressor properties while the mutated p53 augments transformation. 

•	The consequence of this interaction between p53 and high-risk HPV oncoprotein would be equivalent to binding and inactivating an intracellular negative growth regulator, which can lead to unrestricted cellular proliferation. 

•	The mutated p53 gene has been found to be in a high percentage of human colon carcinomas and in human lung cancers. 

•	The elimination of wild-type p53 would be predicted to provide a growth advantage to those cells expressing E6.
