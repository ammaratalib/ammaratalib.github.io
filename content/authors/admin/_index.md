I am Ammara Talib, a Postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Malone's [Disturbance Ecology Lab](https://www.malonelab.org/research), Yale School of Environment. I am interested in using process-based and machine learning/deep learning/artificial intelligence models to predict and forecast water quality and quantity issues and diagnose diseases.

For my doctoral thesis, I am using field measurements collected 
with support from the [Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Growers Association]( https://wisconsinpotatoes.com/) Water Task Force, [the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources]( https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/Groundwater/GCC/research.htm), and the UW [Center for Climatic Research]( https://ccr.nelson.wisc.edu/). The research goal is to quantify the net water budget of this globally crucial agricultural region to constrain groundwater depletion better, improve irrigation management, and understand plant water use under changing climates.

Please see Research/publications for details of current research and previous projects. You can reach me at ammara.talib@yale.edu or send me a direct message on any of my linked websites.
