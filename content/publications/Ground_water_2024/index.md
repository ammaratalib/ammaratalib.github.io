abstract: Monitoring groundwater (GW) level variations, or anomalies in multiple wells, over long periods of time are essential to understanding changes in regional groundwater resource availability. However, it is challenging to predict these GW anomalies over the long term in agricultural areas due to complicated boundary conditions, heterogeneous hydrogeological characteristics, and groundwater extraction, as well as nonlinear interactions among these factors. To overcome this challenge, we developed an advanced modeling framework based on a recurrent neural network of long short-term memory (LSTM) as an alternative to complex and computationally expensive physical models. Our study has shown that land use change and irrigation pumping have interactive effects on GW anomalies forecasting. The novelty of this study is identifying the regional drivers of GW fluxes. This case-specific information and location-related simplification, modification, and assumption of LSTM is a unique contribution to the existing literature. Our framework can be used as an alternative method of simulating water availability and groundwater level changes in areas where subsurface properties are unknown or difficult to determine.

summary: With machine learning methods, anomalies in depth to groundwater can be forecast. Catchment geology, climate, and topography have a strong influence on GW changes. Drivers have site-specific influence on long-term groundwater changes. Irrigation pumping has a stronger influence on GW forecasting than land use change.
