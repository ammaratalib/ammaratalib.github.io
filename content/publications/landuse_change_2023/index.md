abstract: During the past century, land-use change in the SuAsCo (Sudbury-Assabet and Concord) watershed in Massachusetts has altered basin hydrology, sediment, and nutrient load that is detrimental to water resources in SuAsCo. This study uses an integrated physically-based model Hydrological Simulation Program-FORTRAN (HSPF), along with Land Transformation Model (LTM), to assess predicted temporal and spatial changes in water, nutrient, and sediment yields for future land-use scenarios of 2035, 2065, and 2100. Results showed that a 75% increase in effective impervious area and a 50% decrease in forest area in 2100 (from 2005 baseline levels) are projected to cause a 3% increase in annual streamflow and a 69% increase in total yearly mean surface runoff. An increase of 12% and 13% concentrations of average annual total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) are predicted by 2100 due to urban expansion and increased runoff volume. This integrated modeling approach will inform watershed managers and landowners about critical areas of the SuAsCo watershed to apply best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate the effects of land-use land cover (LULC) change.

summary: The reduction in evapotranspiration due to reduced forested land also caused a substantial rise in summer and winter storm runoff under the 2100 scenario. In addition to changes in water balance, TSS yield at the watershed outlet increased by 54% in 2100. The sediment and nutrient yields in the downstream region were generally higher in the downstream Concord River basin than in the upstream Assabet and Sudbury basins.
