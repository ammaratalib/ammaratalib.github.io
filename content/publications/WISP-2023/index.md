abstract: Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is an essential variable in linking energy cycles, carbon, and water, yet challenging to measure. Inputs uncertainty and deficiencies in the key elements of hydrologic models are fundamental challenges for optimizing model performance. Here, we evaluate sources of bias in the regional Wisconsin Irrigation and Scheduling Program (WISP) model and develop a correction using eddy covariance (EC) observations. ET, observations were made for five years (2018â€“2022) using EC systems in agricultural fields in Wisconsin. WISP model ET bias was linked to underestimation of net longwave radiation (LWnet) that was traced to incorrect specification of effective clear sky atmospheric emissivity. Applying this improved model parameterization reduced the bias of LWnet radiation from 62.8% to -6.2%, which improved the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) from -0.08 to 0.52 for ET. Hence, WISP performance improved for different crop types when optimal regional parameters were used, confirming the physical parameters' reliability. Our results highlight that model development should focus on energy balance parameterizations to improve ET simulation and the accuracy of hydrologic and climatic simulations for understanding critical processes underlying hydrologic and climatic variability and change over land.
