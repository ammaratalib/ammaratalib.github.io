#slides: "Measuring EC Fluxes"
summary:  How tall? The taller the tower, the large area ET you measure (around 10-100x upwind of tower). Needs to be at least ~6 feet above canopy. How much power? Can be run on solar, continuously log data at ten times a second, output ET and carbon fluxes every 30 minutes.

How reliable are fluxtowers? 
As long as sample area is homogenous and uptime is good, eddy covariance is the gold standard for field-regional ET

Flux towers have pros/cons:

PROS: 
- Easy to deploy on a tripod in a field, on solar power
- No moving parts, and mostly off-the-shelf technology
- Nearly 500 long running sites worldwide
- “gold standard”. It is one of the only ways to directly measure ET at hourly time scale
- At the same time, we also measure the surface heat exchange, carbon dioxide flux (productivity), and climate. 

CONS: 
- It is relatively expensive (total around $40-50K to purchase)
- Requires significant expertise (technical personnel), and regular maintenance.
- EC measures only upwind of the tower and when the atmosphere is “turbulent”, requiring application of methods to fill in data gaps and quality control data
