Abstract: Changes in land use land cover (LULC) impact watersheds. Changes in rate of interception, evapotranspiration (ET), infiltration, and runoff have impacts on soil loss and nutrient loads into water bodies. Hence, there is a need to evaluate the influences of LULC on watershed systems in order to develop effective conservation policies. This study aims to model these effects using LULC change as a driver of watershed processes. This study is conducted in Sudbury, Assabet and Concord (SuAsCo) watershed in Massachusetts that has high runoff, and water quality impacts from sediments and nutrients loading. A calibrated watershed model (HSPF) is used to simulate water flows and water quality changes and validated using field data. Regional built-out scenarios of LULC changes are used to assess watershed wide impacts. Results indicate that changes in LULC significantly affect water flows and water quality. There is a potential for reducing runoff, sediments and nutrients loads by using conservation strategies such as carefully selected best management practices (BMPs), cost sharing and spatially targeted incentives. This study provides valuable information to watershed managers and landowners for protecting those watershed systems that are undergoing LULC changes like rapid urbanization.
