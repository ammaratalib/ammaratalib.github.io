Ways to measure ET:

- Meteorological approximations: Thornthwaite, Priestly-Taylor, Penman-Montieth – Strong assumptions on surface properties, ET driven by radiation 

- Residual: Measure precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, back out ET – Subject to high uncertainty Lysimeters: Labor-intensive, small-area estimate 

- Remote sensing:  Assumptions on links between electromagnetic radiation and ET, satellites don’t work with clouds 

- Process models: Captures all aspects but requires extensive, hard to measure parameters 

- Eddy covariance: Direct method, whole field, expensive and expertise required

- Machine “Learning”: Site-specific, hard to extrapolate or interpret, but powerful for forecasting
