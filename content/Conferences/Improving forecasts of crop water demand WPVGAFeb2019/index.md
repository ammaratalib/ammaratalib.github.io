summary:  For a wet year, pines ET is higher than potatoes. In dry years when pine ET is more moisture limited, pine evapotranspiration could be lower, according to previous studies.

Pines are wetter on the surface. But later the difference between pine and potatoes soil moisture decreases. Pines have more transpiration and less soil evaporation. Deeper in the ground (around 18 inches depth) potatoes have more soil moisture. Water use by different crop types in Midwest (2017,2018) was compared under different soil types. Even same crop type can lead to different water used based on soil condition. Cumulatively corn water loss in Illinois (IL) was about four inches higher than WI potatoes.
